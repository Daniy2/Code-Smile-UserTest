# 🧪 CodeSmile – User Testing Instructions

Welcome, and thank you for participating in the **user testing** of [CodeSmile](https://github.com/Daniy2/CodeSmile), a tool for detecting Machine Learning-specific code smells (ML-CSs) in Python projects.

This experiment is part of a thesis project at the University of Salerno.

---

## 📋 What You Need to Do

You will complete two code smell detection tasks:

### 🧩 1. Analyze some Python files manually or using CodeSmile
Depending on your assigned group (you’ll be told via email), you will:

- **Group A**:  
  🧠 First perform manual analysis → then use the CodeSmile tool

- **Group B**:  
  ⚙️ First use CodeSmile → then try to detect code smells manually

You’ll be analyzing a small set of Python files with known ML-related code smells.

## 📎 Where to Find the Tool

You can find the full CodeSmile project and usage instructions here:

👉 **[CodeSmile Repository – Plugin + CLI Tool](https://github.com/Daniy2/CodeSmile)**

There you’ll find how to:
- Install the plugin and its dependencies
- Run it inside IntelliJ or via CLI
- Understand the different detection modes (real-time, single file, etc.)

## 📝 After Finishing the Tasks

Once you’ve completed both parts of the task, **please fill in the final evaluation form**:

- 📄 [Go to the Google Form →](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScePSCDN3hEFrgH77paO0wzzr9zGTU_t_PsvYbYcQUNAT0hoQ/viewform?usp=dialog) **Group A**
- 📄 [Go to the Google Form → ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU9ybqT1-pfRZq7zGjJpr2aMTOSeYTpehCH8vhV2Ap_8B08g/viewform?usp=dialog) **Group B**

In the form, you will be asked:
- What code smells you found
- How hard it was to find them
- Your experience using CodeSmile
- Suggestions and feedback
